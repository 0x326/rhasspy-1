* Before starting significant work, please propose it and discuss it first on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/synesthesiam/rhasspy/issues) on GitHub. Other people may have suggestions, will want to collaborate and will wish to review your code.
* Please work on one piece of conceptual work at a time. Keep each narrative of work in a different branch.
* As much as possible, have each commit solve one problem.
* A commit must not leave the project in a non-functional state.
* Run the unit tests before you create a commit.
* Treat code, tests and documentation as one.
* Create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) from your fork.

## Development workflow

If you want to start working on a specific feature or bug fix, this is an example workflow:

* Synchronize your fork with the upstream repository.
* Create a new branch: `git checkout -b <nameofbranch>`
* Create your changes.
* Add the changed files with `git add <files>`.
* Commit your changes with `git commit`.
* Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.
* Create a pull request from your fork.
